    <p class="borde w-[18rem]">
    At its Synod in 1870, the Methodist Church 
    in Ghana decidedto establish an all-boys secondary 
    school, dedicated to fostering intellectual, 
    moral and spiritual growth. Accordingly, on Monday
    3rd April 1876, the Wesleyan High School (now Mfantsipim) 
    started operating in Cape Coast as the first
    Methodist Secondary School and also the first-second 
    cycle in the then Gold Coast. The school
    started with 17 students and James Picot, 
    who was only 18 as the first Headmaster.
    Ten foundation students present at the inauguration
     of the school were: John Mensah Sarbah, 
     George Grant, Henry Van Hein,
     William Fynn Penny (later Rev. Fynn Egyir
    Asaam), William Fynn, Robert J. Hayfron, Benjamin Pine Wood, 
    Samuel C. Crankson, Brodie Arthur and John James Clement.
    The school changed names several times before John Mensah-Sarbah, 
    one of the pioneer students who had become an accomplished lawyer 
    came up with the name ‘Mfantsipim’. It started as the Wesleyan High 
    School, became High School and Training Instruction, Wesleyan 
    Collegiate School, Richmond College and finally Mfantsipim.
    For Sarbah and his friends, the name “Mfantsipim” was not to be 
    broken into syllables to indicate “Mfantsefo Apem” (A thousand 
    Fantes). They were more focused on the future needs of the country 
    as a whole and to them “Mfantsipim” meant the ‘Soul of the People’ 
    and it was in the School that the “souls of the people of Ghana” 
    would mature. Mensah Sarbah also gave the school its motto “Dwen 
    Hwe Kan” which, translated literally means “Think and look ahead”

    <p>The school also changed locations several times. From the Mission
    House to the former Colonial School on Saltpond Road, Acquah’s 
    house, Coussey’s house at the foot of McCarthy Hill, Government 
    buildings near the Isolation hospital, Sea View House, Mount Hope 
    and eventually settled on the Kwabotwe Hill.
    In 1891 the Wesleyan High School assumed the name of the Wesleyan 
    Collegiate School at a time when it was saddled with challenges such as 
    shortage of funds, unsuitable accommodation, and inadequacy of qualified 
    staff. Under these dire circumstances, John Mensah Sarbah and a few others 
    decided to tackle the problems and formed the Fante Public Schools Limited. 
    The company set up in April 1905, a high school called ‘Mfantsipim’ which 
    was distinct from the Wesleyan Collegiate School. Unfortunately, both 
    schools still experienced serious difficulties and to save the situation, 
    they were merged in July 1905 under the management of the Methodist Church, 
    with the name “Mfantsipim”.
    Over the years, several Headmasters have served the School with distinction. 
    Their vision, commitment, and hard work are what has made the school 
    what it is today. Rev. W.T. Balmer of the Methodist Church, 
    Principal of Richmond College in Sierra Leone arrived in Cape Coast in 
    1907 on an inspection and met only eight (8) dedicated boys in the 
    school teaching themselves because there was neither a teacher nor 
    a Headmaster. He named them the “Faithful Eight” and accepted to stay 
    and take charge of the school as Headmaster. During the centenary 
    celebrations of Mfantsipim in 1976, a monument was erected in their memory.
